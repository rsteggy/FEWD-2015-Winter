	<p>Yeah that's a <em>nice</em> dinosaur. Let's see what our dino expert Alan Grant has to say about dinosaurs:
	<blockquote>"The stegosaurus in my favorite dinosaur. It's kind of the best thing ever.</blockquote>
	Let's list some other dinosaurs:
	<ol> 
		<li>Tricertops 
			<ul>
				<li>But they don't count because they are the worst</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Apatasaurus </li>
		<li>Velociraptor </li>
	</ol> 
	</p>
	<p> So as you may know there are no more dinosaurs. Here's some reasons why the dinosaurs might have died: 
	<ul>
		<li>They didn't eat their jellybeans</li>
		<li>Noah didn't let them on the arc</li>
		<li>A big asteroid killed them all</li>
		<li>They partied too hard</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
